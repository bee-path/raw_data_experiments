Raw data from experiments
====================

## Contents of the folder

This folder contains the data from the experiments with human mobility carried out by the project [Bee-Path](http://bee-path.net/?lang=en).

It currently contains two datasets from experiment being made in 2012. Full details of the experiment are given in [Bee-Path](http://bee-path.net/?lang=en) website and in [1](http://dx.doi.org/10.1098/rsos.160177). The data sets are:

  - The raw data from the experiments: This dataset contains the raw data obtained during the experiment with a previous filtering applied. File: *raw_data_festa_ciencia2012.sql*.
		- Data has been anonymised.
		- Control-testing users have been deleted.
		- Data not corresponding to the dates of experiment or location inside the park has been deleted.
  - The filtered data used in reference [1](http://dx.doi.org/10.1098/rsos.160177): This dataset contains the data from which the analysis done in reference [1](http://dx.doi.org/10.1098/rsos.160177) is done, once a general filtering procedure has been applied. For details on the filtering and its contents, check out the SM of the reference. File: *2016_cleaned_data.csv*.
  
We have recently added a new dataset which contains the same experiment in the same location and the same context. Full details of the experiment are given in [Bee-Path](http://bee-path.net/?lang=en) website. We here provide:

  - The filtered data used the procedure provided by reference [1](http://dx.doi.org/10.1098/rsos.160177): This dataset contains the data from which the analysis done in reference [1](http://dx.doi.org/10.1098/rsos.160177) is done, once a general filtering procedure has been applied. For details on the filtering and its contents, check out the SM of the reference. File: *filtered_data_festa_ciencia2012.sql*.
