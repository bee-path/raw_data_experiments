Raw data from experiments
====================

## Contents of the folder

This folder contains the data from the experiments with human mobility carried out by the project [Bee-Path](http://bee-path.net/?lang=en).

It currently contains two datasets from experiment being made in 2012. These data set is:

  - The raw data from the experiments: This dataset contains the raw data obtained during the experiment with a previous filtering applied. File: *raw_data_festa_ciencia2012.sql*.
		- Data has been anonymised.
		- Control-testing users have been deleted.
		- Data not corresponding to the dates of experiment or location inside the park has been deleted.
  - The filtered data used in reference [1]: This dataset contains the data fromwhich the analysis done in reference [1] is done, once a general filtering procedure has been applied. For details on the filtering and its contents, check out the SM of the reference. File: *filtered_data_festa_ciencia2012.sql*.
